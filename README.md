Motivation:<br />
One of the first tasks of a Tagger when he/she enter the shift is to load the specific environments based on his/her Tagger number and shift start hour.
As the company go bigger, the number of environments increasing as well, and so the duration of environments loading from the Tagging Status.
The goal of this project is to load those environments automatically.
